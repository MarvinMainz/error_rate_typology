Are there definite or specific articles?	1: present, 0: absent	"An article is a marker that accompanies the noun and expresses notions such as (non-)specificity, (in)definiteness and information status (new or given status). Sometimes these notions of specificity, definiteness and information status are summed up in the term ""identifiability"". Articles cannot occur independently, though they might be homophonous with pronouns or numerals that can. A language does not necessarily have both a non-specific/indefinite and a specific/definite marker. These markers often stem from very different sources (numerals and demonstratives) and need not be similar in formal expression or position.
 Formal expression is irrelevant; articles can be free, bound, or marked by suprasegmental markers such as tone.
 Articles are different from demonstratives in that demonstratives occur in a paradigm where there are markers that have a clear spatial deictic function. As demonstratives can grammaticalize into definite or specific articles, they form a natural continuum making it hard to define discrete categories. Articles are more grammaticalized, i.e. are often obligatory in certain contexts that require definite or specific reference. Definite or specific articles can also grammaticalize from pronouns meaning 'a certain'. As articles necessarily accompany nouns, it is in these cases that it is necessary to investigate whether the marker can occur independently or not; if it can it is most likely a pronoun and not an article. Articles can be homophonous with pronouns and demonstratives. See discussions on multifunctionality and take an informed stance in the language-specific case whether these markers are homophonous or polysemic."	1		Vycichl (2005:178, 196); Souag (2013:80-82)	Indefiniteness and definiteness are marked on the noun via stress: ultimate stress marks the indefinite, penultimate stress marks the definite.	article	definiteness	phonologically independent item, affixation and cliticization, declension	5	GB020		JR

Are there 'discontinuous noun phrases'?	1: present, 0: absent	"This is a question concerns the structure of the NP. Can you, for example, say ""The man is running big"" and the like to mean ""The big man is running"". Typically a language which allows this has extensive agreement systems so that you can still work out what modifies what in the NP without them being adjacent. > i.e. the ""Australian type"". NPs that are made up of several coordinated NPs that can be interpreted by the verb or other elements are not relevant here, this features aims to capture NPs where the head and modifiers can be separated.

The adjectival roots need not take exactly all verbal marking. If there is at least some marking that verbal and adjectival roots share then there is a yes here. The result need not be finite, participles would count if that is the way verbs are marked when used attributively.

Are there serial verb constructions?	1: present, 0: absent	Serial verbs are two or more verbs in juxtaposition, functioning as a single predicate, with no morphology to mark their relationship with each other. Each of the verbs is a separate phonological word but the construction as a whole is expressed in one intonational unit. Morphology is shared to a greater or lesser extent. Serial verbs are different from clause-chaining because the verbs involved in clause-chaining lack finiteness and cannot occur independently in that form whereas serial verbs take the appropriate finiteness marking.

Are there verb-adjunct (aka light-verb) constructions?	1: present, 0: absent	"This question concerns constructions involving a non-predicating element expressing the lexical meaning of the construction, in conjunction with a semantically fairly empty verb, which enables the element to function as a predicate by providing the necessary morphology, e.g. 'eye do' for 'see'; or 'sneeze hit' for 'sneeze'. Exclude constructions that fall into the categories of verb compounding, clause-chaining, auxiliaries and serial verbs are excluded from the category of ""light-verb"". The verb needs to be sufficiently productive, it cannot only concern a few instances. It is uninteresting whether the predicating element is of nominal/verbal/other root. This means for example that what is described in the literature as ""co-verb constructions"" most likely are a subcategory of light verbs. It is also uninteresting for the definition of light-verbs whether or not the non-finite predicating element can occur outside the construction or not, both scenarios are acceptable. The category of light verbs cannot all consist of constructions describing states, there has to be at least a few dynamic events. There should also be instances where it is hard to define whether the non-finite predicating element (adjunct) is clearly nominal or not."	1		Lameen Souag (p.c. 2023)	Siwi has a limited number of light-verb constructions.	verb, noun, auxiliary?	predication, derivation	specialized construction	1	GB123		JR

This need not be the default productive way of intransitivizing nouns, but the process needs to be productive. The incorporated noun is the direct object of the verb. For example: ""he was painting the bike"" = ""he was bike-painting"".

Is there one or more existential verb?	1: present, 0: absent	Is there an element expressing existential or locational predication, that is different from the equative or attributive copula? It is possible that there are more than one existential/locational element making further distinctions, temporary versus permanent existence or a special marker for negative existence. Different positional verbs do not count here. The existential/locational marker can be used for the expression of other functions, such as aspect, as long as it is not identical to the copula of identity or attribution.	1		Souag (2010:240, 430-431)		verb, auxiliary	predication, verb classification	specialized construction, phonologically independent item	3	GB126

Do clausal objects occur in the same position as nominal objects?	1: present, 0: absent	By clausal objects here we mean clauses that are directly governed by a finite verb (typically verbs of 'wanting', 'saying' etc.). In other words, complement subordinate clauses and not relative. The question aims at discerning whether they are treated like prototypical nominal direct objects, not indirect or obliques.

Sometimes so called ""Generic THL"" is included in typological surveys of THL, i.e. when the same verbal roots is not repeated but a generic verb (often 'do' or make').

Can polar interrogation be marked by intonation only?	1: present, 0: absent	"There is no other marker in the clause that signals polar interrogation, not even lack of finiteness compared to the affirmative. Intonation needs to be separated from tone because tone can be considered as a particle. intonation is super segmental whereas tone is bound to a constituent (even ""underlying"" tones are bound). If polar interrogation is expressed by a particle with a certain tone, then it is marked by a particle and not by intonation. The issue becomes more complicated if we consider cases where a particle with tone has suffixed and finally merged with the preceding element leaving nothing but the tone left. These are sometimes called “tonal suffixes”. In those cases the tone or intonation would attach to anything preceding, making it hard to distinguish from intonation without the entire phrase contour.
  Intonation is on larger units than a syllable, tone is on one syllable only.

Does the language have inclusory constructions productively?	1: present, 0: absent	Definition: a plural NP that would be expressed in English by an expression of the type ‘Harald and I talked’ or ‘Harald and us talked’ is expressed by a construction of the type [superset: pronoun] [set: noun/Proper noun], e.g. ‘we.two Harald talked’ / ‘we Harald talked’, respectively. Note: In some languages this would be expressed by associative duals/plurals, e.g. Harald-AssDu / AssPl talked’ for ‘[Someone and] Harald talked’, though this tends to be used for non-first-person groups only. It is structurally different in that no part of the associative dual/plural construction refers directly to the superset. Clarification: the element expressing the superset could be either a free pronoun or a bound pronoun.
